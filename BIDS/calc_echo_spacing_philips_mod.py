# Please check results carefully, if possible with physicist of the Philips scanner where data were acquired from.
# 
# For Philips Achieva, the best equation for calculating "effective" echo spacing 
# (corrected for SENSE factor) in milliseconds would seem to be:
#  
# echo spacing in msec = (1000 * wfs)/(434.215 * (etl)) (etl = EPI factor
# + 1)
# 
# We have:
# - matrix size in the phase encoding direction 
# - EPI factor (EPI factor + 1 = echo train length (ETL))
# - water-fat shift per pixel
# - field strength in Tesla

# # We calculate:
# - total bandwidth
# - water-fat shift in Hz
# - bandwidth per pixel in Hz
# - echo spacing in sec
# - echo spacing in msec

# We assume:
# - that the SENSE factor is incorporated in Philips' EPI factor
# - that the water-fat difference in parts-per-million (ppm) is: 3.35 (from Haacke)
# 
# Use for own risk. Please don't use for clinical applications.
